This is an Angular typescript project.

It is a mirror copy of my desktop project TownOfBabylonReal and I can push it to Heroku and it works.

*****I think this repository can be deleted.  I was able to also get the TownOfBabylon repository to work on Heroku and that repository has later changes than this one.
